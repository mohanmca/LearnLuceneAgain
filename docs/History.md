## 🧠 The Engineer Behind Modern Search & Big Data

**Douglas Cutting** is a software engineer who didn’t just *use* systems —
he **built the foundations** of modern **search engines** and **big-data processing**.

## 🔍 Lucene — Building Search from Scratch (1997)

- Created **Lucene**
- A **high-performance text search library**
- Designed core ideas:
  - Inverted Index
  - Relevance scoring
  - Fast full-text search
- Later **donated Lucene to Apache**

👉 *Lucene became the base of most modern search systems.*

## 🌐 Nutch — Searching the Whole Web (2000–2004)

- Created **Nutch**
- Goal: **build an open-source Google-like search engine**
- Combined:
  - Web crawler
  - Indexing using Lucene
- **Initial scale**:
  - Crawling on **4 machines**
  - Later scaled to **20 machines**

⚠️ **Problem:**
Traditional systems **couldn’t scale cheaply**.

## 📄 The Turning Point — Google’s Paper

- Read Google’s **MapReduce** paper
- Key realization:
  > “Distributed processing on commodity hardware is possible.”

💡 This paper **changed everything**.

## 🐘 Hadoop — Big Data for Everyone (2005)

- Created **Hadoop**
- Inspired by:
  - Google File System (GFS)
  - MapReduce
- Built:
  - **HDFS** → Distributed storage
  - **MapReduce** → Parallel computation
- Solved Nutch’s scaling problem

🚀 **Impact:**
- Data processing scaled from **20 machines → thousands**
- Made **Big Data affordable**

---

## 🏛️ Open Source at Scale

- Donated **Lucene**, **Nutch**, and **Hadoop** to Apache
- Became Chairman of the **Apache Software Foundation**
- Helped define modern open-source governance
